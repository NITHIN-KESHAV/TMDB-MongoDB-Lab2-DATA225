# TMDB-MongoDB-Lab2-DATA225-
# This project demonstrates the transition of The Movie Database (TMDB) to a cloud-based platform, leveraging MongoDB to enhance data management and analysis. Using Python for data processing, the project involves cleaning and transferring metadata for 45,000 movies, including user ratings, into a MongoDB database. This transition underscores the scalability and accessibility benefits of a cloud-native database solution, illustrating how it can revolutionize data handling and analytics within the film industry. MongoDB's flexible schema and powerful indexing capabilities enable dynamic queries and efficient data retrieval, making it ideal for handling complex datasets like TMDB![image](https://github.com/NITHIN-KESHAV/TMDB-MongoDB-Lab2-DATA225-/assets/25931450/70e5eebe-b451-41f1-bc5a-d5bc269579a5)
